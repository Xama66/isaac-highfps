// The single source of the release version. package.bat parses this line for the zip

// companion compares it against the newest version it was uploaded with.

// Releasing therefore means: bump this, run package.bat, publish the zip - and bump
// LATEST in the companion's main.lua and re-upload it, or nobody gets told to update.
